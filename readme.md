Assignment 2 - Git Mission Statements
CSCI-UA.0480: Collaborating Remotely: Build Software from Anywhere

This is a repository for Assignment 2 of Collaborating Remotely. The purpose is to practice and test brancing and merging.

For this assignment, I am taking Ikea's mission statement and suggesting edits to be made to the statement on a separate branch. Once I am done suggesting edits on my branch, I merge my branch with the main branch. The goal is to make edits on a branch different from main, merge the two branches, resolve any conflicts that may arise, and end up with an improved mission statement.
